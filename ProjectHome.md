[ProgressiveScroll](http://code.google.com/p/progressive-scroll/) is a [MetalScroll](http://code.google.com/p/metalscroll/) clone for VS2010 and higher. It replaces the scrollbar with a graphic representation of the code.

Features:
  * Double clicking highlights the selected word in the editor and the scrollbar.
  * Pressing Escape clears the highlights.
  * Coloring options for whitespace, comments, strings, highlights, bookmarks and breakpoints. These can be found in Tools > Options > Fonts and Colors.
  * Adjustable width (This and other settings can be found under Tools > Options > Progressive Scroll).
  * Uses the space that is usually wasted in the bottom right corner of the editor and hides the splitter control in the top right corner.

**Warning!** Does not work well with word wrap.
